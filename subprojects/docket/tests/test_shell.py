"""Where bash ends a line of a script, and how `shell_words` reads the newlines inside one.

A workflow step's script reaches bash whole, so `tools/doc_check.py` cuts it with
`shell.script_lines` rather than a line at a time, which read a here-document's
body as commands and declined a command continued past its line (`PL-Q9LK`).
Every shape below was run through bash 5.2.21 first; the one place this reading
departs from it, a body its delimiter never ends, is pinned as the departure.
