"""What git already knows about work in progress.

Whether an item is being worked on right now is a fact the repository
already holds: a branch named after it exists. Storing that in the item file
instead would mean a session has to remember to write it when it starts and
to clear it when it stops - and a session that crashes, or that is simply
abandoned, leaves the item marked in-progress forever with nobody able to
tell whether that is true.

So it is derived, never stored. A branch that is gone means work that is not
in flight, which is exactly right: branches are deleted when their pull
request merges.

The same holds for finished work: which pull requests have reached the
default branch is a fact the repository holds, so an item's recorded pull
request can be checked against it rather than trusted.
