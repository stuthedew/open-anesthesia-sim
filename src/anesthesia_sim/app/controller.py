        The interface calls this when a drag begins. Without it a slider

        both arrive as a run of changes to the same control, and only the
        input device knows where one act ended and the next began. Guessing
        it back from the timing of the entries would need a threshold, and
        no threshold survives the playback multiplier v0.4.0 adds - the same
        drag spans more simulated time the faster the run is played.

        It records nothing on its own and changes no simulation state: it
        only closes whichever adjustment is open, so the next change starts
        a new one. A change that arrives with no adjustment open - a
        keyboard press on a slider, a programmatic call, a test - therefore
        becomes an adjustment of its own, which is the honest reading of a
        single discrete input and the reason the grouping degrades safely

        Called *after* the forwarding setter returns, which is what makes a
        refused setting record nothing: the core raises before this line is
        reached, the exception reaches the interface, and the run - which
        the core left untouched - keeps a timeline that says so.

        Both values are read off the compartment that holds them rather
        than taken from the caller's argument. The core rejects an
        out-of-range setting rather than clamping it, so the two are equal
        today - but a record of what was *asked for* would silently become
        a record of something the run never used the day that stopped being
        true, and this timeline's whole claim is that re-applying it
        reproduces the run.

        Two changes are deliberately not recorded, and both are cases where
        the model saw nothing:

        - a value equal to the one already in place, which a slider emits
          freely as a drag re-enters a position; and
        - a change superseded within the same simulation step. Only the
          value standing when `advance()` runs is integrated, so a dial
          moved from 2% to 3% to 4% between two steps is one change from 2%
          to 4% as far as the run is concerned. Collapsing them is what
          makes the timeline a record of the run rather than of the mouse -
          and if the collapse lands back on the value the step began with,
          the entry goes entirely, because nothing about the run differs.
