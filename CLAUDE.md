# Repository instructions

These instructions apply to all AI coding agents working on this repository.

## Architecture and development discipline

- Keep scientific/simulation code independent of Flet.
- Put no simulation calculations in UI callbacks.
- Treat simulation time as explicit state, never wall-clock time.
- Preserve deterministic results for identical inputs.
- Add or update tests with every core behavior change.
- Keep agent/model parameters in validated, versioned data files.
- Do not add executable equations to data files.
- Do not implement beyond the current milestone.
- Run pytest, Ruff, and the configured type checker before finishing.

## Safety-critical clinical-output standard

This application is intended as an educational/simulation tool and will carry appropriate disclaimers that it is not intended for clinical patient care. Nevertheless, assume that a clinician could use displayed values or model outputs to influence real-world patient management.

Therefore, any code path or displayed information that could plausibly affect patient management must be treated as safety-critical. Examples include:

- drug dose, infusion-rate, concentration, weight-based, or unit calculations;
- PK/PD state calculations and predictions;
- effect-site concentrations, predicted effects, MAC-equivalent values, interaction surfaces, and similar derived clinical values;
- model selection and model-compatibility logic;
- covariate transformations such as weight scalars, age adjustments, allometry, renal/hepatic modifiers, or unit conversions;
- thresholds, warnings, alarms, recommendation-like language, or other information a clinician might act on;
- values presented in graphs, tables, labels, or summaries where an error could alter clinical interpretation.

For safety-critical paths:

- Favor correctness, traceability, explicitness, and auditability over cleverness, abstraction, convenience, or development speed.
- Keep calculation logic pure and independent from presentation/UI code whenever feasible.
- Use explicit units and avoid implicit unit conversions. Prefer unit-aware types or equivalent safeguards where practical.
- Validate required inputs, units, ranges, model applicability, and model compatibility before calculation.
- Do not silently substitute defaults, coerce invalid data, or continue with missing required inputs when doing so could produce a plausible but incorrect clinical value.
- Version and record provenance for scientific models, equations, constants, parameter sets, and clinically meaningful transformations.
- Maintain deterministic behavior for identical inputs and model versions.
- Validate numerical implementations against published reference cases, analytic solutions, independently calculated test vectors, or other authoritative references whenever available.
- Include boundary, invalid-input, pathological-input, and regression tests in addition to ordinary nominal-case tests.
- When a safety-critical bug is found, add a regression test that would have caught it.
- Prefer an obvious failure/error state to displaying a plausible-looking number when correctness cannot be established.
- Treat presentation correctness as part of safety: the correct number with the wrong units, label, patient context, stale state, model name/version, or provenance is still a safety failure.
- Test the end-to-end path when appropriate: patient inputs -> model selection -> calculation -> units -> formatting -> displayed value.
- Make clinically meaningful displayed values traceable to the exact model/version, inputs, units, and transformations that produced them.

Disclaimers do not lower the engineering standard for these paths.
