**Problem.** `SimulationController._concentration_history` appends one
sample per `advance()` and nothing ever trims it. At the fixed 0.1 s step
that is 36 000 samples per hour of simulated time, held for the life of the
session.
**Why it matters.** No longer a rendering problem — PL-001 made the render
payload independent of history length — but still unbounded memory growth in
a long teaching session. Lower priority than it looks: a slotted dataclass of
seven floats is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so an hour costs single-
digit MB.
**Where.** `app/controller.py` (`_concentration_history`, `advance`).
**First step.** Decide what the history is *for* now that the chart no longer
consumes all of it. If it is the record of a run (a future export or replay
feature), it should stay complete and the fix is a documented ceiling with an
explicit failure at the limit rather than silent trimming.
**Done when.** Memory growth over a long run is bounded, or the retention
policy is documented and deliberate rather than accidental.
